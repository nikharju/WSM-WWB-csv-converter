# WSM-WWB-csv-converter
Reformat csv scan files from Wireless Systems Manager (WSM) into Shure Wireless Workbench (WWB) compatible csv

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
This program imports radio frequency scan files created in and exported from Sennheisers software Wireless Systems Manager (WSM) as .csv files and reformats them to a csv format that works with Shures software Wireless Workbench (WWB).
Simply click 'Open file...' to import the WSM file and click 'Convert to WWB...' and choose a location and name to save the new file with the new formatting.
After that you can import the newly created scan file into WWB.

DISCLAIMER!
This program is in no way affiliated with neither Sennheiser nor Shure coorporations, nor is it supported by them. It is a tool created by me personally to help with the task of using Sennheiser hardware and software for scanning radio frequency spectrums and use that data for frequency planning in WWB.
